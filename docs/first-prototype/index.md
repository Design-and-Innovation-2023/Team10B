# First Prototype

We designed our first robot car prototype based on what we have discovered from the exploration phase.

## Sketches

From experimenting with the curio, we realize that weight distribution also affects the speed. These sketches have the phone to rest on the battery pack to overcome the weight distribution if we incorporate the smartibot with the curio.

## Learning points

- Need more work to align with our goals 
  
- Need to be easier to build

- Speed might still be affected due to material
