## Teaching Assistant (claretb)

I liked how in your video, you **expressed your initial thoughts** about the design and then, with the **feedback** from your partner, managed to **define an MVP** for yourselves. This way, you successfully created a **clear goal statement** and sharpened your objectives.

While reviewing your daily logs, the example of the prototype applied on Curio caught my attention, and I was **hoping to see that sketch** in the video as well. The explanations and the identified problems that could be addressed with this prototype were well expressed. Instead of focusing on Smartibot in the video, it would have been **more effective to highlight and discuss the changes that could be made on Curio**.

As a team, I can advise you to focus on **creating designs and presenting analyses on Curio**. This way, you can receive feedback more easily from partners and also evaluate your own prototypes to gain insights. If you can also mention the learnings you gained from the prototype next time, Iâ€™m sure we will make even more progress.

P.S. I had a lot of fun with the design of your presentation, the robot figures around it were very intriguing :slight_smile:

## Professor (jgrizou)

Video sounds sped up. Please do this with caution, the **video is bordeline too fast** to follow.

**Learned from user**

I am glad we managed to re-align on the scope of this project, I think you now have a good picture of what the goals are.

**How likely do you think it is that a robot get damaged?**

I like the sustainable angle, but was not sure on **which specific parts** do you think we can improve upon?

Learned from prototype

I am **not sure about what you learned from the Smartibot** at this stage. Am I right to say that the video say that the Smartibot has a clear front and back because of the face on the robot? **Did you learn anything else from it?**
