## Teaching Assistant (claretb)

Except the speed of video, everything seems fine for video style.

Clients gave some feedback on last week’s video, but it seems there were **no meeting and questions from the team this week to receive more**. I was expecting to see **more feedbacks and learnings from users**.

I **can’t understand the idea behind prototype 2**. How people create their own designs? If they create their own, which issue is solved by this prototype? I think it is already Smartibot and do you have enough materials and instructions like Smartibot?

Attachment idea sounds good, but we want to see **something tested at this stage**. There are some possibilities about its usage, but did you created attachments and tested them with the robot? How about your partners? Did they hear about it in a meeting?

## Professor (jgrizou)

Felt at the edge of the speed conformable to follow what you say. It was a big hard to follow.

**Learned from user**

It felt more like a defense of your choices than an acknowledgement of what was learned. Can you see why I am saying this and the difference between the two?

**Learned from prototype**

**Why would lower center of gravity = more speed?** Just curious on a physics basis I am not sure it make sense or what you are trying to get to.

Prototype 3 felt interesting with the hole on the top of the head to be slided in

**Feedback**

I understand you picked the angle of smartibot mixed with Curio but I am not sure **how feasible what you propose** would be for another person to build.

**What would be a good outcome** for your project? Do you plan to offer the plans of the robot on your website? Maybe a tutorial on how to build it?

Overall, **I don’t think you met with your client enough :slight_smile:** , there is lot we could have discussed on a day to day basis.
