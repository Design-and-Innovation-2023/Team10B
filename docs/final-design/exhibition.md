## Reflection

We decided to showcase the BattleBot version of Educraft as we felt that it would be engaging for the visitors, especially during the hands-on practice sessions. Initially, we were concerned that our stand would not be visible to others as we were allocated a spot in a corner. However, as the crowd came in and saw Educraft moving around the exhibition, it sparked visitors' curiosity and led them towards our stand to inquire about the bot and the inspiration behind it. Perhaps that was a cheeky attempt, but it proved to be a good marketing strategy to pique people's curiosity about our work.

As mentioned, our stand became busy with lots of people learning about our goals and the features we worked on to improve Curio and turn it into Educraft. They also shared that our goal would reach a wider audience if it were open to children as well. One such visitor was a primary school teacher who found it intuitive to set up the BattleBot version of Educraft in just 10 minutes. The step-by-step guide was simple enough for his students to follow. He also expressed interest in letting his students play around with it and was concerned about whether there might be complex coding required that could be a little too advanced for them. However, seeing how easily configurable it was on the app for setting up, he was reassured about its simplicity and had fun playing around with the robot.

Additionally, partners from other teams were also intrigued by Educraft, given the crowd, and started inquiring about its usability. One partner particularly liked the team's vision of extending affordability goals by using sustainable everyday objects. They were impressed to see that it was able to move around at a decent level of speed without breaking apart, despite running since the start of the exhibition. Apart from the usability tests we conducted, we had a great opportunity to gather input and feedback from users at the exhibition, which will be beneficial for the team to continue improving Educraft as part of the design process. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience for everyone involved, and the team felt proud to see people enjoying our product.
