# Introduction

In this design journal, we will document our journey through the iterative design thinking process. We will explore various methodologies that we've identified as useful during the design thinking process, and we'll record our progress in the other sections of this journal. 

By documenting our process, we aim to gain insights, learn from our mistakes, and ultimately arrive at an effective and innovative design solution.

## Specification

We will explore design ideas to improve the Curio project, a low-cost educational platform designed to teach programming to undergraduate students. The current Curio robot consists of basic components but can feel limiting at times. We need to identify its positives and limitations through testing with people around us.
