# 2nd Prototype

We created our 2nd robot design using AutoCAD this time.


## AutoCAD Sketches

Based on previous learning points, we came up with a few ideas such as this “rover” like design where the base can be used of cereal boxes to address the sustainability and if damaged its easily available for replacement.

## Learning points

- Achieves the sustainability and affordability goal

- Phone stand angle issue
  
- Might be hard for wheels to turn if its compact
  
- Lower Centre of gravity = more speed
