# 3rd Prototype (Final Design)

Learning from the previous iterations, we focused our efforts on creating a new iteration that incorporates gamification and versatility. Our team decided to design a "battlebot" that comes equipped with various "weapons". This concept allows students to unleash their creativity and design their own unique "battlebot" or other types of robots, as instructed by their educator. This prototype also emphasizes a base Curio design that consists of the slot for the device and the attachments, promoting a modular design approach.

## Final Design 

We have chosen this prototype as the final design for the exhibition based on careful consideration of its features and trade-offs. We believe that this design strikes the best balance between addressing the needs of our client and Curio designer, while keeping the robot's complexity in check. Moreover, we have added gamification and versatility to the design, making it more engaging and appealing to end users. Overall, we are confident that this prototype achieves our [goals](/docs/introduction#goals) effectively and efficiently. Our exhibition poster can be found [here](/docs/final-design/poster).


## Design Thinking

The "Empathize" section is mentioned in the [1st prototype page](/docs/prototypes/first-prototype/). "Define" and "Ideate" is mentioned at the previous section of this page.

### Prototype (Sketches)

**Core Unit:**

The core unit is a compact box where a phone can be sloted inside it. The smartibot control board acts as the front ("face") of our car. Cramp was not needed anymore as the slot can hold the phone securely without it.

**Attachments:**

We have developed several attachments that can be connected to the core unit as part of the "battlebot" design. For instance, we have created a knife and shield that can be controlled by the smartibot control board using a servo mechanism. These attachments offer students the opportunity to personalize their "battlebot" and engage in exciting battles with their peers.

### Test

**Guide:**

The guide to build the battlebot can be found [here](/docs/battle-bot-prototype3-instruction.pdf).

**Core Unit Template:**

We created the core unit template so that users to cut and assemble the robot with greater ease.

**Photos:**

We have physically build the prototype.

## Learning points

This prototype successfully fulfills our goals of affordability, versatility, and sustainability. However, the design is more complex and may require additional effort to build. To make the process easier for users, we provided blueprint-like templates using cardboard pieces or 3D printable files. This will allow users to cut and assemble the robot with greater ease.
