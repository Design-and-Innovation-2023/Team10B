# 3rd Prototype

Learning from the previous iterations, we focused our efforts on creating a new iteration that incorporates gamification and customization. Our team decided to design a "battlebot" that comes equipped with various "weapons". This concept allows students to unleash their creativity and design their own unique "battlebot" or other types of robots, as instructed by their educator. This prototype also emphasizes a base Curio design that consists of the slot for the device and the attachments, promoting a modular design approach.

## Design Thinking

The "Empathize" section is mentioned in the [1st prototype page](/docs/prototypes/first-prototype/). "Define" and "Ideate" is mentioned at the previous section of this page. 

### Prototype (Sketches)

**Core Unit:**

The core unit is a compact box where a phone can be sloted inside it. The smartibot control board acts as the front ("face") of our car. Cramp was not needed anymore as the slot can hold the phone securely without it.

**Attachments:**

We have developed several attachments that can be connected to the core unit as part of the "battlebot" design. For instance, we have created a knife and shield that can be controlled by the smartibot control board using a servo mechanism. These attachments offer students the opportunity to personalize their "battlebot" and engage in exciting battles with their peers.

### Test (Videos)

We have physically build the prototype.

**Core unit:**

The video shows that the core unit is stable enough to move in all direction despite it being more compact.

### Implement

This idea was not chosen as our final prototype.

## Learning points

This prototype successfully fulfills our goals of affordability, customizability, and sustainability. However, the design is more complex and may require additional effort to build. To make the process easier for users, we plan to provide blueprint-like templates using cardboard pieces or 3D printable files. This will allow users to cut and assemble the robot with greater ease.
