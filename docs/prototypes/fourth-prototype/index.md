# 4th Prototype


Learning from the previous iterations and feedback from partners, we acknowledge that simplicity in setting up the Curio is essential, as the current process might be time-consuming. To address this concern, we are implementing a simpler modular design with easily attachable parts. By fixing the parts like puzzles that lock them in place, setting up the Curio will be more efficient.


## Design Thinking

The "Empathize" section is mentioned in the [1st prototype page](/docs/prototypes/first-prototype/). "Define" and "Ideate" is mentioned at the previous section of this page. 

### Prototype (Sketch)

This sketch shows the components that we need to assemble to build the robot.

### Test (Photos)

We use cardboard to make the sketch prototype.

**Front:**

Wwe drew inspiration from the phone holder design of Curio and enhanced it to make it more stable. Specifically, we added a "kerb" to the front of the holder and widened the "wall" on the side to provide better support for the phone. This design allows for greater flexibility in placing the phone at a desired angle.

### Test (Videos)

The video shows how the robot can be disassembled easily.

## Learning points

This prototype successfully fulfills our goals of affordability, customizability, and sustainability. However, the design is simpler compared to the [3rd prototype](/docs/prototypes/third-prototype/). Just like the 3rd prototype, we plan to provide blueprint-like templates using cardboard pieces or 3D printable files.
