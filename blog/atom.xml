        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="todays-progress">Today’s Progress:<a href="#todays-progress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Today’s Progress:" title="Direct link to Today’s Progress:">​</a></h2><p><strong>Clarifying Deliverables</strong>: Today, we had a productive discussion with our professor to gain clarity on the project deliverables. The conversation allowed us to understand the project’s expectations better and what is actually required of the team.</p><p><strong>Simplified Assembly</strong>: The professor stressed the importance of ensuring our final product is easy to assemble, similar to an ‘out-of-the-box’ concept. He also highlighted the comparisons between the curio and smartibot design features and how each design had its own advantages and disadvantages and finding a middle ground between the two designs would be ideal.</p><p><strong>Iterative Design</strong>: We also established that while our final product can be one finalized design, it is crucial to document and demonstrate the design iterations that lead to the final product. This will showcase our design journey and the considerations that shaped the final product.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prototyping-session">Prototyping Session:<a href="#prototyping-session" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prototyping Session:" title="Direct link to Prototyping Session:">​</a></h2><p>Our class today was dedicated to understanding more about prototyping methodologies. We gained insights into choosing a prototyping method suitable for our project as well as clearing up any prior misconceptions we had about prototyping. It also helped us learn more about the logic and steps to prototyping that we may not have considered going into the class.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reflections-and-learnings">Reflections and Learnings:<a href="#reflections-and-learnings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reflections and Learnings:" title="Direct link to Reflections and Learnings:">​</a></h2><p>Overall, the professor’s advice has given us a clearer direction on how to approach the design process. We understood the importance of simplicity and ease of assembly in our design, which will guide our prototyping phase. Learning about various prototyping methodologies has also given us a toolbox of techniques we can choose from, depending on the specific needs of each design iteration.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smartibot">Smartibot<a href="#smartibot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smartibot" title="Direct link to Smartibot">​</a></h2><p>We sketched this out to find out more about how we can incorporate certain design features of the smartibot into our prototype.</p><p>Front view of the smartibot:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Front view" src="/Team10B/assets/images/smartibot-front-192e5fb9efa2aee4c1e29dfd66d13a0b.jpeg" width="1713" height="1803" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Back view of the smartibot:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Back view" src="/Team10B/assets/images/smartibot-back-ae3a63635a26bbe6383115d66b5255d0.jpeg" width="2013" height="1921" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="images-of-sketches">Images of Sketches:<a href="#images-of-sketches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Images of Sketches:" title="Direct link to Images of Sketches:">​</a></h2><p>We have sketched some preliminary ideas.</p><p><strong>Initial Idea 1:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="idea 1" src="/Team10B/assets/images/idea1-7efbe9c03c15501db3b52606f2e7fff6.jpg" width="1464" height="1612" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Initial Idea 2:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="idea 2" src="/Team10B/assets/images/idea2-764f0f79859fb368eb3be3b1d3fb71f7.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

The primary aim was to add value while still keeping the design affordable and accessible.</p></li><li><p>We strategized and came up with a number of design implementations, aiming to optimize the robot’s functionality and user interaction:</p><ul><li>Face + Speed: A base design using the base features of the smartibot to address the issue with identifying the front of the robot and the speed of the robot</li><li>Smartibot with Curio: Explored the feasibility of integrating Smartibot into Curio. This aims to enhance the design by enabling quicker and more effective design explorations.</li><li>Teapot Design with Phone: Explored the potential of implementing the ‘teapot’ design of the smartibot kit while including a dedicated spot for the user’s phone. This would improve user interaction and extend the capabilities of the robot by leveraging the phone’s sensors.</li><li>Battle Bots: Brainstormed ideas for a ‘Battle Bots’ feature that enables users to add components to the base of the robot using simple household materials.</li><li>Base Plate with Face + Attachments that can Self-Make (Tentative): Contemplated on an innovative base plate design with a ‘face’ and the ability to replace certain components of the robot if faulty using simple household materials given a base plate.</li><li>Challenges: Identifying the balance between innovative design and cost-effectiveness</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upcoming-priorities">Upcoming Priorities:<a href="#upcoming-priorities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upcoming Priorities:" title="Direct link to Upcoming Priorities:">​</a></h2><ul><li>Start sketching out designs based on the ideas that were generated during the meeting.</li><li>Establishing concrete goals and deadlines for each design iteration.</li></ul>]]></content>
