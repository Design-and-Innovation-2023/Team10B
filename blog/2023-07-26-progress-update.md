## Today’s Progress:

**Consultation with the Professor**: We consulted with the professor regarding our current prototype design yesterday. The discussion brought to light several key points to ponder about:

1. We could replace the front design of the smartibot with a simpler design that was easier to assemble.

2. Battery Pack Integration: Incorporating the Curio robot’s battery pack, which can be recharged using a Type-C cable, was considered a valuable step. This will reduce the need for frequent battery replacements when the robot ran out of battery.

3. We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.

**Feedback Response**: We received some insightful comments suggesting the creation of an attachable design with various modules. The suggestion to consider using the existing Curio design and create additional attachments was especially interesting. We thought of some ideas in that we could add more holes into the base of the curio robot which allowed for modifications or additional modules to be added to the robot via the holes. This could help encourage students to be more creative with their robot designs.

It’s good idea exactly but can you explain more about how justifying design choices can make the learning better?
