## Today’s Progress:

- **Sketches**: Our team worked on creating new design sketches using AutoCAD. The focus of these sketches was to envision a design that is simple to assemble and uses recyclable materials such as cardboard.

- **Weekly Pitch Video Feedback**: We received valuable feedback on our presentation video from both our professor and teaching assistant. Their comments have given us a fresh perspective and actionable insights to improve our design process and future presentations.

## Our thoughts on the feedback

Overall we felt that our project was on the right track as the our goals and the scope of the project align with what the professor had in mind. We were also able to gain insight into what aspect of the project we should focus on such as the designs and analyses on Curio as well as the specific parts of the Curio robot that can be improved on in terms of sustainability. The professor also pointed out the fact of the likelihood of the robot being damaged which was something that we considered as group and felt that one possible solution was including a “base plate” sort of design where the user could replace the damaged part by cutting out an outline on a piece of cardboard on the base plate. We also noted that we should include what we learnt from the prototypes and pick out certain features or points that can be incorporated into our final design such as the front and back of the smartibot. We gained valuable feedback on the video as a whole and will tweak the future pitch videos to sound less sped up, include our learning and the designs and analyses on Curio.
