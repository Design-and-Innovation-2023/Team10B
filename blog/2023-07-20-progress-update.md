## Today’s Progress:

- Initiated discussions on design iterations for the Curio robot. The primary aim was to add value while still keeping the design affordable and accessible.

- We strategized and came up with a number of design implementations, aiming to optimize the robot’s functionality and user interaction:
  - Face + Speed: A base design using the base features of the smartibot to address the issue with identifying the front of the robot and the speed of the robot
  - Smartibot with Curio: Explored the feasibility of integrating Smartibot into Curio. This aims to enhance the design by enabling quicker and more effective design explorations.
  - Teapot Design with Phone: Explored the potential of implementing the ‘teapot’ design of the smartibot kit while including a dedicated spot for the user’s phone. This would improve user interaction and extend the capabilities of the robot by leveraging the phone’s sensors.
  - Battle Bots: Brainstormed ideas for a ‘Battle Bots’ feature that enables users to add components to the base of the robot using simple household materials.
  - Base Plate with Face + Attachments that can Self-Make (Tentative): Contemplated on an innovative base plate design with a ‘face’ and the ability to replace certain components of the robot if faulty using simple household materials given a base plate.
  - Challenges: Identifying the balance between innovative design and cost-effectiveness

## Upcoming Priorities:

- Start sketching out designs based on the ideas that were generated during the meeting.
- Establishing concrete goals and deadlines for each design iteration.
