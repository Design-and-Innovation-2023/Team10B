            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="todays-progress">Today’s Progress:<a href="#todays-progress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Today’s Progress:" title="Direct link to Today’s Progress:">​</a></h2><p><strong>Designer Engagement Session:</strong>
Today, we had an enriching conversation with the designer of the Curio robot. We discussed various design aspects and gathered valuable insights to steer our prototyping process. Here’s a summary of the key points shared:</p><ul><li>Stepper Motors: The designer emphasized the use of stepper motors as the most cost-efficient option for achieving precision, a key requirement for the Curio robot.</li><li>Constraints: Challenges include enabling the robot to tilt at various angles.</li><li>Experimental Process: The designer acknowledged that a lot of the ongoing work is still experimental.</li><li>Easy Assembly and Detachability: He pointed out that it takes a while to assemble the entire robot, and an easy-to-assemble and detachable design would be beneficial.</li><li>Keeping Material Costs Low: Efforts are made to use cost-effective materials. For example, servo motors with electronic magnets were deemed impractical as they would cost two-thirds of the entire cost. The wheels and back wheel are always kept in stock, and materials used are kept simple, with possibilities of using 3D printing and plastic for wheels.</li><li>Phone Stand: The current phone stand design was identified as a weak point due to its floppiness.</li><li>Modularity: Modularity is preferred as most universities can 3D print the components.</li><li>Hardware Constraints: Curio has a control board which is impossible to have users make from scratch. Thus, the main constraints for the robot are in hardware, specifically the motor.</li></ul><p><strong>Feedback on our Prototype:</strong></p><ul><li>The designer suggested using a stepper motor instead of a DC motor (like in the Smartibot) to aid with precision.</li><li>He praised the versatility of our design, which allows students to assemble the robot as per their preference instead of shipping a fully assembled bot, which might get damaged in transit.</li><li>He was impressed with the clamp design, suggesting we should consider our specific use case and work towards it.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teaching-assistant-claretb-feedback">Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback<a href="#teaching-assistant-claretb-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback" title="Direct link to Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback">​</a></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Team10B:</strong> We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning.

For example, from the student’s point of view, when they are building and using their Curio robots they are able to understand these design choices gives them insight into how the robot works and why.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sketches">Sketches<a href="#sketches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sketches" title="Direct link to Sketches">​</a></h2><p>We came out with another prototype sketch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sketch" src="/Team10B/assets/images/sketch-cadd40f74fe707a841f0c48d66fa9239.jpeg" width="2048" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prototype">Prototype<a href="#prototype" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prototype" title="Direct link to Prototype">​</a></h2><p>We use cardboard to make the sketch prototype.</p><p><strong>Front:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Attachment" src="/Team10B/assets/images/front-prototype-2e331c92659d8230ce2c39818aa73e06.jpeg" width="999" height="750" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Side:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Side" src="/Team10B/assets/images/side-prototype-eb8afcd9e190704c18de787a08ff074a.jpeg" width="2048" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

The discussion brought to light several key points to ponder about:</p><ol><li><p>We could replace the front design of the smartibot with a simpler design that was easier to assemble.</p></li><li><p>Battery Pack Integration: Incorporating the Curio robot’s battery pack, which can be recharged using a Type-C cable, was considered a valuable step. This will reduce the need for frequent battery replacements when the robot ran out of battery.</p></li><li><p>We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Feedback Response</strong>: We received some insightful comments suggesting the creation of an attachable design with various modules. The suggestion to consider using the existing Curio design and create additional attachments was especially interesting. We thought of some ideas in that we could add more holes into the base of the curio robot which allowed for modifications or additional modules to be added to the robot via the holes. This could help encourage students to be more creative with their robot designs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teaching-assistant-claretb-feedback">Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback<a href="#teaching-assistant-claretb-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback" title="Direct link to Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning.

We were also able to gain insight into what aspect of the project we should focus on such as the designs and analyses on Curio as well as the specific parts of the Curio robot that can be improved on in terms of sustainability. The professor also pointed out the fact of the likelihood of the robot being damaged which was something that we considered as group and felt that one possible solution was including a “base plate” sort of design where the user could replace the damaged part by cutting out an outline on a piece of cardboard on the base plate. We also noted that we should include what we learnt from the prototypes and pick out certain features or points that can be incorporated into our final design such as the front and back of the smartibot. We gained valuable feedback on the video as a whole and will tweak the future pitch videos to sound less sped up, include our learning and the designs and analyses on Curio.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autocad-sketches">AutoCAD Sketches<a href="#autocad-sketches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AutoCAD Sketches" title="Direct link to AutoCAD Sketches">​</a></h2><p>Front view:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Front view" src="/Team10B/assets/images/front-0387b872c049ed83fc7238b99b819e1d.jpeg" width="398" height="352" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Back view:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Back view" src="/Team10B/assets/images/back-64e3c74ae9373b16b7da2c7b5a967fa1.jpeg" width="543" height="474" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Side view:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Side view" src="/Team10B/assets/images/side-93b5bb0867a0ded7a80f373dde4af129.jpeg" width="881" height="365" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

This way, you successfully created a <strong>clear goal statement</strong> and sharpened your objectives.</p><p>While reviewing your daily logs, the example of the prototype applied on Curio caught my attention, and I was <strong>hoping to see that sketch</strong> in the video as well. The explanations and the identified problems that could be addressed with this prototype were well expressed. Instead of focusing on Smartibot in the video, it would have been <strong>more effective to highlight and discuss the changes that could be made on Curio</strong>.</p><p>As a team, I can advise you to focus on <strong>creating designs and presenting analyses on Curio</strong>. This way, you can receive feedback more easily from partners and also evaluate your own prototypes to gain insights. If you can also mention the learnings you gained from the prototype next time, I’m sure we will make even more progress.</p><p>P.S. I had a lot of fun with the design of your presentation, the robot figures around it were very intriguing :slight_smile:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="professor-jgrizou">Professor (jgrizou)<a href="#professor-jgrizou" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Professor (jgrizou)" title="Direct link to Professor (jgrizou)">​</a></h2><p>Video sounds sped up.

Am I right to say that the video say that the Smartibot has a clear front and back because of the face on the robot? <strong>Did you learn anything else from it?</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>
