## Designer Sharing

1. Stepper motor is the most cost efficient to get the result he wants since precision is the goal
   
2. Constraints : being able to tilt the robot in various angles

3. A lot of the stuff being done is still experimental

4. Would be beneficial if parts are easily assembled and detachable, it takes a while to assemble the entire robot.

5. Trying to keep the material cost down to something sensible for example servo motors with the electronic magnet are not practical as they cost 2/3 of the entire cost making sure the wheels and the back wheel are always in stock. trying to keep the material used simple, might consider implementing 3d printing , consider using plastic for the wheel.

6. Another weak point would be the phone stand. (Very floppy)

7. keep it to a reasonably small amount of parts

8. It is nice to have modularity as most universities are able to 3d print it

9.  Curio does have a control board and it is not possible to get the user to make a new control board from scratch, so focus of robot main constraints are the hardware(specifically motor)

## Designer Feedback for team 10A prototypes

1. Appreciates the rotation of the 2nd prototype as that facing.so his consideration but advise to ensure the wheels are rotatable in the direction that the camera is facing

2. Reinstate to have easier alternative to tilt the angle of the phone which the team plans to overcome using servo motors to automate angle positioning of the phone

3. When using 3 wheels, need a steering wheel(ball bearing)



## Designer Feedback for team 10B prototypes

1. Could consider using a stepper motor rather than DC(smartibot) to aid with the precision.
   
2. He likes the versality aspect of the design and having the students to assemble to their liking rather than sending an assembled bot which might be damaged in transit.

3. He likes the clamp design and does not have a use case when designing curio, we should think about our use case and work towards it

4. Initially he did not have a use case so the advice was to have a use case to work on the problems, e.g., if speed is something we are working on then focus on that direction such as point 2
