## Today’s Progress:

**Clarifying Deliverables**: Today, we had a productive discussion with our professor to gain clarity on the project deliverables. The conversation allowed us to understand the project’s expectations better and what is actually required of the team.

**Simplified Assembly**: The professor stressed the importance of ensuring our final product is easy to assemble, similar to an ‘out-of-the-box’ concept. He also highlighted the comparisons between the curio and smartibot design features and how each design had its own advantages and disadvantages and finding a middle ground between the two designs would be ideal.

**Iterative Design**: We also established that while our final product can be one finalized design, it is crucial to document and demonstrate the design iterations that lead to the final product. This will showcase our design journey and the considerations that shaped the final product.

## Prototyping Session:

Our class today was dedicated to understanding more about prototyping methodologies. We gained insights into choosing a prototyping method suitable for our project as well as clearing up any prior misconceptions we had about prototyping. It also helped us learn more about the logic and steps to prototyping that we may not have considered going into the class.

## Reflections and Learnings:

Overall, the professor’s advice has given us a clearer direction on how to approach the design process. We understood the importance of simplicity and ease of assembly in our design, which will guide our prototyping phase. Learning about various prototyping methodologies has also given us a toolbox of techniques we can choose from, depending on the specific needs of each design iteration.

## Smartibot

We sketched this out to find out more about how we can incorporate certain design features of the smartibot into our prototype.
