## Curio

[Curio](https://trycurio.com/) is a web-based platform that teaches kids how to code by using a small, affordable robot. The robot is connected to your computer or smartphone via Bluetooth, and you can use the Curio website to control it and write code for it.

Curio is designed to be easy to use, even for kids who have never coded before. The website has a step-by-step tutorial that walks you through the process of writing code for the robot. There are also a variety of activities that you can do with the robot, such as making it follow a line, avoid obstacles, or even play games.
