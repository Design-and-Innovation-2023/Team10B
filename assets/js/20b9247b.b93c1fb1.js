Our chosen prototype to display was the BattleBot version of Educraft, as we felt that it would be engaging for the visitors, especially during the hands-on practice sessions.\\n\\n**Challenges**: Initially, we faced challenges with our stand placement, located in a less visible corner of the exhibition. However, this turned into a blessing in disguise as the movement of our BattleBot across the floor piqued the curiosity of the attendees, drawing them towards our corner to learn more about our project.\\n\\n**Visitor Engagement**: Our stand became a bustling point of interest, with visitors keen on learning about our goals and the features we worked on to improve Curio and turn it into Educraft. One notable interaction was with a primary school teacher, who found it intuitive to set up the BattleBot version of Educraft in just 10 minutes. The step-by-step guide was simple enough for his students to follow. He also expressed interest in letting his students play around with it and was concerned about whether there might be complex coding required that could be a little too advanced for them. However, seeing how easily configurable it was on the app for setting up, he was reassured about its simplicity and had fun playing around with the robot.\\n\\n**Peers\u2019 Interest**: The high level of engagement at our stand didn\u2019t go unnoticed by partners from other teams. We received positive feedback, particularly about our vision of promoting affordability through the use of sustainable, everyday objects. Observing Educraft\u2019s performance throughout the exhibition, they were impressed with its durability and speed.\\n\\n**Learning Opportunities**: The exhibition provided a rich opportunity for gathering real-time feedback, furthering our understanding of user interactions and needs. It will also be beneficial for the team to continue improving Educraft as part of the design process.\\n\\n**Final Reflection**: The exhibition was not just an opportunity to showcase our work but also a learning experience. Seeing people interact with and enjoy Educraft was gratifying and a testament to the hard work and dedication our team put into the project."},{"id":"2023-08-01-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-08-01-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-08-01-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-01-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-08-01)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress:","date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":1.04,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"Members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-08-01-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-08-01)","authors":"team10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-08-03)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-08-03-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-31)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-31-progress-update"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress:\\n\\n**Consultation Progress:**\\n\\nWe had a constructive consultation session with our professor, focusing on feedback from our video pitch.

For example, is the aim of the battlebot to topple another robot? By adding some visual cues such as adding a marker at the end of the arm of the battlebot to show the other battle bot being hit would be helpful.\\n\\n3. **Narrative & Context**: The professor emphasized the importance of providing a clear narrative of what our robot is built for, including an explanation of our design thinking process.

It was also perceived as being too wordy, creating confusion between it being a product page or a blog. We worked on this feedback by streamlining the content and making it more straightforward.\\n\\n2. **GitHub link**: The inclusion of the GitHub link led some users to believe we were promoting an open-source project. We felt that the github link was a useful addition to the website to allow users to find relevant code relating to the curio robot.\\n\\n3. **Project ownership**: It was unclear who was behind the project. We addressed this by adding an about us section on our website.\\n\\n4. **Target audience**: Users were unsure who the robot was designed for.\\n\\n5. **Changes to the robot**: Users were able to identify the changes made to the robot, indicating that our visual presentations were effective.\\n\\n6. **Design journal clarity**: The design journal was missing the process and thinking behind our design decisions.

The session emphasized the importance of ensuring our designs and prototypes are both effective and user-friendly. The key takeaways are:\\n\\n- Usability testing allows us to identify potential issues and areas of confusion in a design before it becomes a finalized product.\\n- The process involves asking the intended users of a product to perform certain tasks under observation. This enables us to see where they might encounter problems or feel confused.\\n- Collecting data from a diverse user base is crucial as different individuals might interact with the product differently.\\n- The feedback collected from usability testing is a vital resource that can guide us in refining and enhancing our design.\\n\\n**Instruction Creation Activity:**\\n\\nWe also conducted an activity that involved creating instructions to guide a user in building a specific object. In our case, we decided to write steps to create a paper plane. We unexpectedly found that it was difficult to write steps to create the paper plane as it had to be specific enough for the user to recreate the plane and simple enough that the steps were not too complex and prevent the user from following or understanding the steps. This exercise highlighted the need for clear and concise instructions that users of varying ages and abilities can follow easily.\\n\\n## Learning points\\n\\n- Understanding your audience: Knowing whether we are testing on a teenager or an older individual, for instance, is crucial, as it might influence how the instructions are designed and delivered.\\n- Time taken to learn: Monitoring the time it takes for a user to learn how to use or build the prototype can provide valuable insights into the intuitiveness and ease-of-use of our designs.\\n- we also learnt the importance of giving the right tasks for the testing such as making it actionable, realistic, specific, in order to obtain the most information from the user, such as their thought process when navigating our website."},{"id":"2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2-feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2-feedback","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2-feedback.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2-feedback.md","title":"Weekly Pitch 2 Feedback (2023-07-28)","description":"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"weekly-pitch","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/weekly-pitch"}],"readingTime":1.655,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"Members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2-feedback","title":"Weekly Pitch 2 Feedback (2023-07-28)","authors":"team10b","tags":["weekly-pitch"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-28)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-28-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Pitch 2 (2023-07-28)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-28-weekly-pitch-2"}},"content":"[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zYYJXYxaqTI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYYJXYxaqTI)\\n\\n\\n## Teaching Assistant (claretb)\\n\\nExcept the speed of video, everything seems fine for video style.\\n\\nClients gave some feedback on last week\u2019s video, but it seems there were **no meeting and questions from the team this week to receive more**.

We discussed various design aspects and gathered valuable insights to steer our prototyping process. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points shared:\\n\\n- Stepper Motors: The designer emphasized the use of stepper motors as the most cost-efficient option for achieving precision, a key requirement for the Curio robot.\\n- Constraints: Challenges include enabling the robot to tilt at various angles.\\n- Experimental Process: The designer acknowledged that a lot of the ongoing work is still experimental.\\n- Easy Assembly and Detachability: He pointed out that it takes a while to assemble the entire robot, and an easy-to-assemble and detachable design would be beneficial.\\n- Keeping Material Costs Low: Efforts are made to use cost-effective materials. For example, servo motors with electronic magnets were deemed impractical as they would cost two-thirds of the entire cost. The wheels and back wheel are always kept in stock, and materials used are kept simple, with possibilities of using 3D printing and plastic for wheels.\\n- Phone Stand: The current phone stand design was identified as a weak point due to its floppiness.\\n- Modularity: Modularity is preferred as most universities can 3D print the components.\\n- Hardware Constraints: Curio has a control board which is impossible to have users make from scratch. Thus, the main constraints for the robot are in hardware, specifically the motor.\\n\\n**Feedback on our Prototype:**\\n\\n- The designer suggested using a stepper motor instead of a DC motor (like in the Smartibot) to aid with precision.\\n- He praised the versatility of our design, which allows students to assemble the robot as per their preference instead of shipping a fully assembled bot, which might get damaged in transit.\\n- He was impressed with the clamp design, suggesting we should consider our specific use case and work towards it.\\n\\n## Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback\\n\\n>**Team10B:** We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning.

We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.\\n\\n**Feedback Response**: We received some insightful comments suggesting the creation of an attachable design with various modules. The suggestion to consider using the existing Curio design and create additional attachments was especially interesting. We thought of some ideas in that we could add more holes into the base of the curio robot which allowed for modifications or additional modules to be added to the robot via the holes.

We were also able to gain insight into what aspect of the project we should focus on such as the designs and analyses on Curio as well as the specific parts of the Curio robot that can be improved on in terms of sustainability. The professor also pointed out the fact of the likelihood of the robot being damaged which was something that we considered as group and felt that one possible solution was including a \u201cbase plate\u201d sort of design where the user could replace the damaged part by cutting out an outline on a piece of cardboard on the base plate. We also noted that we should include what we learnt from the prototypes and pick out certain features or points that can be incorporated into our final design such as the front and back of the smartibot.
