The session emphasized the importance of ensuring our designs and prototypes are both effective and user-friendly. The key takeaways are:\\n\\n- Usability testing allows us to identify potential issues and areas of confusion in a design before it becomes a finalized product.\\n- The process involves asking the intended users of a product to perform certain tasks under observation. This enables us to see where they might encounter problems or feel confused.\\n- Collecting data from a diverse user base is crucial as different individuals might interact with the product differently.\\n- The feedback collected from usability testing is a vital resource that can guide us in refining and enhancing our design.\\n\\n**Instruction Creation Activity:**\\n\\nWe also conducted an activity that involved creating instructions to guide a user in building a specific object. In our case, we decided to write steps to create a paper plane. We unexpectedly found that it was difficult to write steps to create the paper plane as it had to be specific enough for the user to recreate the plane and simple enough that the steps were not too complex and prevent the user from following or understanding the steps. This exercise highlighted the need for clear and concise instructions that users of varying ages and abilities can follow easily.\\n\\n## Learning points\\n\\n- Understanding your audience: Knowing whether we are testing on a teenager or an older individual, for instance, is crucial, as it might influence how the instructions are designed and delivered.\\n- Time taken to learn: Monitoring the time it takes for a user to learn how to use or build the prototype can provide valuable insights into the intuitiveness and ease-of-use of our designs.\\n- we also learnt the importance of giving the right tasks for the testing such as making it actionable, realistic, specific, in order to obtain the most information from the user, such as their thought process when navigating our website."},{"id":"2023-07-27-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-27-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-27-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-27-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-27)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress:","date":"2023-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":2.345,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"Members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-27-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-27)","authors":"team10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-28)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-28-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-26)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-26-progress-update"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress:\\n\\n**Designer Engagement Session:**\\nToday, we had an enriching conversation with the designer of the Curio robot. We discussed various design aspects and gathered valuable insights to steer our prototyping process. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points shared:\\n\\n- Stepper Motors: The designer emphasized the use of stepper motors as the most cost-efficient option for achieving precision, a key requirement for the Curio robot.\\n- Constraints: Challenges include enabling the robot to tilt at various angles.\\n- Experimental Process: The designer acknowledged that a lot of the ongoing work is still experimental.\\n- Easy Assembly and Detachability: He pointed out that it takes a while to assemble the entire robot, and an easy-to-assemble and detachable design would be beneficial.\\n- Keeping Material Costs Low: Efforts are made to use cost-effective materials. For example, servo motors with electronic magnets were deemed impractical as they would cost two-thirds of the entire cost. The wheels and back wheel are always kept in stock, and materials used are kept simple, with possibilities of using 3D printing and plastic for wheels.\\n- Phone Stand: The current phone stand design was identified as a weak point due to its floppiness.\\n- Modularity: Modularity is preferred as most universities can 3D print the components.\\n- Hardware Constraints: Curio has a control board which is impossible to have users make from scratch. Thus, the main constraints for the robot are in hardware, specifically the motor.\\n\\n**Feedback on our Prototype:**\\n\\n- The designer suggested using a stepper motor instead of a DC motor (like in the Smartibot) to aid with precision.\\n- He praised the versatility of our design, which allows students to assemble the robot as per their preference instead of shipping a fully assembled bot, which might get damaged in transit.\\n- He was impressed with the clamp design, suggesting we should consider our specific use case and work towards it.\\n\\n## Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback\\n\\n>**Team10B:** We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.\\n\\n>**Claretb:** It\u2019s good idea exactly but can you explain more about how justifying design choices can make the learning better?\\n\\n**Team10B:** Thanks for the question, when we mentioned \u2018justifying design choices,\u2019 we meant more about explaining the rationale behind why we\u2019ve chosen to design our robot in a particular way. For example, from the student\u2019s point of view, when they are building and using their Curio robots they are able to understand these design choices gives them insight into how the robot works and why.\\n\\n\\n## Sketches\\n\\nWe came out with another prototype sketch.\\n\\n![Sketch](/img/fourth-prototype/sketch.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n## Prototype\\n\\nWe use cardboard to make the sketch prototype.\\n\\n**Front:**\\n\\n![Attachment](/img/fourth-prototype/front-prototype.jpeg)\\n\\n**Side:**\\n\\n![Side](/img/fourth-prototype/side-prototype.jpeg)"},{"id":"2023-07-26-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-26-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-26-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-26-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-26)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress:","date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":1.335,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"Members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-26-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-26)","authors":"team10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-27)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-27-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-25)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-25-progress-update"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress:\\n\\n**Consultation with the Professor**: We consulted with the professor regarding our current prototype design yesterday. The discussion brought to light several key points to ponder about:\\n\\n1. We could replace the front design of the smartibot with a simpler design that was easier to assemble.\\n\\n2. Battery Pack Integration: Incorporating the Curio robot\u2019s battery pack, which can be recharged using a Type-C cable, was considered a valuable step. This will reduce the need for frequent battery replacements when the robot ran out of battery.\\n\\n3. We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.\\n\\n**Feedback Response**: We received some insightful comments suggesting the creation of an attachable design with various modules. The suggestion to consider using the existing Curio design and create additional attachments was especially interesting.
