The discussion brought to light several key points to ponder about:\\n\\n1. We could replace the front design of the smartibot with a simpler design that was easier to assemble.\\n\\n2. Battery Pack Integration: Incorporating the Curio robot\u2019s battery pack, which can be recharged using a Type-C cable, was considered a valuable step. This will reduce the need for frequent battery replacements when the robot ran out of battery.\\n\\n3. We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning. This includes justifying design choices, such as the addition of a adjustable phone stand at the back of the Smartibot.\\n\\n**Feedback Response**: We received some insightful comments suggesting the creation of an attachable design with various modules. The suggestion to consider using the existing Curio design and create additional attachments was especially interesting. We thought of some ideas in that we could add more holes into the base of the curio robot which allowed for modifications or additional modules to be added to the robot via the holes. This could help encourage students to be more creative with their robot designs.\\n\\n\\n### Teaching Assistant (claretb) Feedback\\n\\n>We agreed that we need to further refine our design to increase its value in facilitating learning.

Their comments have given us a fresh perspective and actionable insights to improve our design process and future presentations.\\n\\n## Our thoughts on the feedback\\n\\nOverall we felt that our project was on the right track as the our goals and the scope of the project align with what the professor had in mind. We were also able to gain insight into what aspect of the project we should focus on such as the designs and analyses on Curio as well as the specific parts of the Curio robot that can be improved on in terms of sustainability. The professor also pointed out the fact of the likelihood of the robot being damaged which was something that we considered as group and felt that one possible solution was including a \u201cbase plate\u201d sort of design where the user could replace the damaged part by cutting out an outline on a piece of cardboard on the base plate. We also noted that we should include what we learnt from the prototypes and pick out certain features or points that can be incorporated into our final design such as the front and back of the smartibot. We gained valuable feedback on the video as a whole and will tweak the future pitch videos to sound less sped up, include our learning and the designs and analyses on Curio.\\n\\n## AutoCAD Sketches\\n\\nFront view:\\n\\n![Front view](/img/second-draft/front.jpeg)\\n\\nBack view:\\n\\n![Back view](/img/second-draft/back.jpeg)\\n\\nSide view:\\n\\n![Side view](/img/second-draft/side.jpeg)"},{"id":"2023-07-24-weekly-pitch-1-feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-24-weekly-pitch-1-feedback","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-24-weekly-pitch-1-feedback.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-24-weekly-pitch-1-feedback.md","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 Feedback (2023-07-24)","description":"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE","date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 24, 2023","tags":[{"label":"weekly-pitch","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/weekly-pitch"}],"readingTime":1.655,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"Members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-24-weekly-pitch-1-feedback","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 Feedback (2023-07-24)","authors":"team10b","tags":["weekly-pitch"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-24)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-24-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-21)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-21-progress-update"}},"content":"[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Oz5KXsxkr6E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz5KXsxkr6E)\\n\\n\\n## Teaching Assistant (claretb)\\n\\nI liked how in your video, you **expressed your initial thoughts** about the design and then, with the **feedback** from your partner, managed to **define an MVP** for yourselves.

The explanations and the identified problems that could be addressed with this prototype were well expressed. Instead of focusing on Smartibot in the video, it would have been **more effective to highlight and discuss the changes that could be made on Curio**.\\n\\nAs a team, I can advise you to focus on **creating designs and presenting analyses on Curio**. This way, you can receive feedback more easily from partners and also evaluate your own prototypes to gain insights.
