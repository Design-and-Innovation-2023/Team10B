The conversation allowed us to understand the project\u2019s expectations better and what is actually required of the team.\\n\\n**Simplified Assembly**: The professor stressed the importance of ensuring our final product is easy to assemble, similar to an \u2018out-of-the-box\u2019 concept. He also highlighted the comparisons between the curio and smartibot design features and how each design had its own advantages and disadvantages and finding a middle ground between the two designs would be ideal.\\n\\n**Iterative Design**: We also established that while our final product can be one finalized design, it is crucial to document and demonstrate the design iterations that lead to the final product. This will showcase our design journey and the considerations that shaped the final product.\\n\\n## Prototyping Session:\\n\\nOur class today was dedicated to understanding more about prototyping methodologies. We gained insights into choosing a prototyping method suitable for our project as well as clearing up any prior misconceptions we had about prototyping. It also helped us learn more about the logic and steps to prototyping that we may not have considered going into the class.\\n\\n## Reflections and Learnings:\\n\\nOverall, the professor\u2019s advice has given us a clearer direction on how to approach the design process. We understood the importance of simplicity and ease of assembly in our design, which will guide our prototyping phase. Learning about various prototyping methodologies has also given us a toolbox of techniques we can choose from, depending on the specific needs of each design iteration.\\n\\n## Smartibot\\n\\nWe sketched this out to find out more about how we can incorporate certain design features of the smartibot into our prototype.\\n\\nFront view of the smartibot:\\n\\n![Front view](/img/first-draft/smartibot-front.jpeg)\\n\\nBack view of the smartibot:\\n\\n![Back view](/img/first-draft/smartibot-back.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n## Images of Sketches:\\n\\nWe have sketched some preliminary ideas.\\n\\n**Initial Idea 1:**\\n\\n![idea 1](/img/first-draft/idea1.jpg)\\n\\n\\n**Initial Idea 2:**\\n\\n![idea 2](/img/first-draft/idea2.jpg)"},{"id":"2023-07-20-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-20-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-20-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-20)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress:","date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":1.27,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-20-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-20)","authors":"team10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-21)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-21-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress:\\n\\n- Initiated discussions on design iterations for the Curio robot. The primary aim was to add value while still keeping the design affordable and accessible.\\n\\n- We strategized and came up with a number of design implementations, aiming to optimize the robot\u2019s functionality and user interaction:\\n  - Face + Speed: A base design using the base features of the smartibot to address the issue with identifying the front of the robot and the speed of the robot\\n  - Smartibot with Curio: Explored the feasibility of integrating Smartibot into Curio. This aims to enhance the design by enabling quicker and more effective design explorations.\\n  - Teapot Design with Phone: Explored the potential of implementing the \u2018teapot\u2019 design of the smartibot kit while including a dedicated spot for the user\u2019s phone. This would improve user interaction and extend the capabilities of the robot by leveraging the phone\u2019s sensors.\\n  - Battle Bots: Brainstormed ideas for a \u2018Battle Bots\u2019 feature that enables users to add components to the base of the robot using simple household materials.\\n  - Base Plate with Face + Attachments that can Self-Make (Tentative): Contemplated on an innovative base plate design with a \u2018face\u2019 and the ability to replace certain components of the robot if faulty using simple household materials given a base plate.\\n  - Challenges: Identifying the balance between innovative design and cost-effectiveness\\n\\n## Upcoming Priorities:\\n\\n- Start sketching out designs based on the ideas that were generated during the meeting.\\n- Establishing concrete goals and deadlines for each design iteration."},{"id":"2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1.md","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","description":"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE","date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"weekly-pitch","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/weekly-pitch"}],"readingTime":0.02,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","authors":"team10b","tags":["weekly-pitch"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-20)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update"}},"content":"[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Oz5KXsxkr6E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz5KXsxkr6E)"},{"id":"2023-07-19-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress","date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 19, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":0.335,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Team 10B","title":"members of Team 10B","key":"team10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-19-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","authors":"team10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-18)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-18-progress-update"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress\\n\\n1.
