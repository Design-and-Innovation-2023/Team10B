The primary aim was to add value while still keeping the design affordable and accessible.\\n\\n- We strategized and came up with a number of design implementations, aiming to optimize the robot\u2019s functionality and user interaction:\\n  - Face + Speed: A base design using the base features of the smartibot to address the issue with identifying the front of the robot and the speed of the robot\\n  - Smartibot with Curio: Explored the feasibility of integrating Smartibot into Curio. This aims to enhance the design by enabling quicker and more effective design explorations.\\n  - Teapot Design with Phone: Explored the potential of implementing the \u2018teapot\u2019 design of the smartibot kit while including a dedicated spot for the user\u2019s phone. This would improve user interaction and extend the capabilities of the robot by leveraging the phone\u2019s sensors.\\n  - Battle Bots: Brainstormed ideas for a \u2018Battle Bots\u2019 feature that enables users to add components to the base of the robot using simple household materials.\\n  - Base Plate with Face + Attachments that can Self-Make (Tentative): Contemplated on an innovative base plate design with a \u2018face\u2019 and the ability to replace certain components of the robot if faulty using simple household materials given a base plate.\\n  - Challenges: Identifying the balance between innovative design and cost-effectiveness\\n\\n## Upcoming Priorities:\\n\\n- Start sketching out designs based on the ideas that were generated during the meeting.\\n- Establishing concrete goals and deadlines for each design iteration."},{"id":"2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1.md","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","description":"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE","date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"weekly-pitch","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/weekly-pitch"}],"readingTime":0.02,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Group 10B","title":"Team members of Group 10B","key":"group10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1","title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","authors":"group10b","tags":["weekly-pitch"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-20)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-progress-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update"}},"content":"[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Oz5KXsxkr6E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz5KXsxkr6E)"},{"id":"2023-07-19-progress-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-19-progress-update.md","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","description":"Today\u2019s Progress","date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 19, 2023","tags":[{"label":"progress-update","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/tags/progress-update"}],"readingTime":0.335,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Group 10B","title":"Team members of Group 10B","key":"group10b"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-07-19-progress-update","title":"Progress Update (2023-07-19)","authors":"group10b","tags":["progress-update"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Pitch 1 (2023-07-20)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-20-weekly-pitch-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Progress Update (2023-07-18)","permalink":"/Team10B/blog/2023-07-18-progress-update"}},"content":"## Today\u2019s Progress\\n\\n1.
