To address this concern, we are implementing a simpler modular design with easily attachable parts. By fixing the parts like puzzles that lock them in place, setting up the Curio will be more efficient.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"prototypes/second-prototype/index":{"id":"prototypes/second-prototype/index","title":"2nd Prototype","description":"Learning from the previous iteration, we recognized the need for further exploration, especially concerning sustainability goals. Consequently, the focus of this prototype is on using recyclable parts, such as cereal boxes, as an extension to the Curio base (phone holder). This approach ensures that if any part gets damaged, it can be easily replaced.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"prototypes/third-prototype/index":{"id":"prototypes/third-prototype/index","title":"3rd Prototype (Final Design)","description":"Learning from the previous iterations, we focused our efforts on creating a new iteration that incorporates gamification and versatility. Our team decided to design a \\"battlebot\\" that comes equipped with various \\"weapons\\". This concept allows students to unleash their creativity and design their own unique \\"battlebot\\" or other types of robots, as instructed by their educator. This prototype also emphasizes a base Curio design that consists of the slot for the device and the attachments, promoting a modular design approach.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"team-reflection":{"id":"team-reflection","title":"Team Reflection","description":"The Design Project module has presented us with a challenge to step out of our comfort zone and unleash our creativity. As we had not previously collaborated on any projects, our primary task was to establish a shared mental model and promote effective communication and teamwork to focus on and execute the project successfully. Fortunately, we achieved this through the implementation of a team contract, which helped us overcome our differences in mental models and facilitated open and constructive communication, enabling us to support one another throughout the project.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"weekly-pitches/weekly-pitch-1":{"id":"weekly-pitches/weekly-pitch-1","title":"Weekly Pitch 1","description":"The video and the feedback of weekly pitch 1.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"weekly-pitches/weekly-pitch-2":{"id":"weekly-pitches/weekly-pitch-2","title":"Weekly Pitch 2","description":"The video and the feedback of weekly pitch 2.","sidebar":"designSidebar"}}}')}}]);
